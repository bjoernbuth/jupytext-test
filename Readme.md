# jupytext tests

This repo is intended for my personal use. It contains a few tests of the jupytext package.

## conversion-script

The bash script is the one I am currently using. I'll try to keep it updated with the latest
of my script (which is currently located in the scripts/python-helper-scripts folder).
If you would like to use the script in a similar way, I recommend adapting the script to your
needs and then put it somewhere in your PATH.
