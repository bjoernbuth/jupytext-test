# jupytext tests

This repo is intended for my personal use. It contains a few tests of the jupytext package.

## conversion-script

The bash script is the one I am currently using. I'll try to keep it updated with the latest
of my script (which is currently located in the scripts/python-helper-scripts folder).
If you would like to use the script in a similar way, I recommend adapting the script to your
needs and then put it somewhere in your PATH.

## nbconvert remarks

- I was having some problems when the version of jupyter notebook was too high (7.0 or higher).
  I guess this is related to the new notebook format.
  (TODO3: understand why the problems occured and why the fix worked (currently no time for this
  since I need to work on other things))
